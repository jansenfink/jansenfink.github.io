When I was a child, I had many aspirations: I wanted to be a professional athlete, a veterinarian, or a surgeon; ironically enough, I was very clumsy and did not like to see any pet or person in pain. Despite my deal-breaking limitations, I was still young enough to believe it was possible. One thing that I never thought about becoming when I was a child, was a software engineer. I was always told I was smart, but I didn't believe I was *that* smart. 

My first real exposure to coding was at a lego camp I attended when I was in elementary school; we were given the options to build the lego sets, or to type code into the computer - I chose the latter. As my partner built the traffic light, I typed in the code given to me on a sheet of paper, line by line, into the editor. When we executed the code I had entered, the traffic light turned on. I was amazed that writing, what seemed to me as random nonsense, could make something happen. I started thinking about everything that relies on code and became overwhelmed. I felt powerful seeing my code activate the lego traffic light, but then I realized that "my" code was actually someone else's; the only thing I had done was read it from the paper and type it into the editor. I thought that coding was the coolest job someone could have, but that it wasn't for me. 

My journey to where I am now has been filled with many ups and downs and detours. I majored in music at LSU and wanted to pursue a doctorate in music cognition, but then realized that I could not afford to do so. I decided that I should just get a "normal job" until I could afford graduate school. While looking through job openings, I found an apprenticeship program. About 6 months into the program, I was asked if I would be interested in learning to code; I was ecstatic, but still a bit unsure of my ability. As I started learning to code, I felt like it was the perfect fit for someone like me. I have always been super detail-oriented, which can get annoying at times, but definitely comes in handy when someone needs help fixing their code because of a missing semicolon or curly brace. I felt more and more empowered by the code I was able to write (even though it was rather basic), and then decided that I really wanted to learn how to code like a professional. 

Being in the apprenticeship program, I was able to see how coding directly affected the end-user and that inspired me to learn to code so that I could make processes more efficient for the business and more ergonomic for the front-line worker. I cannot wait to see what I can achieve with the knowledge I gain during my experience at Flatiron.
